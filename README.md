# Team Techy Warriors
This repository contains all code files and data we used in the IBMHC 2020 project for the Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets. 
In this project, we utilized twitter data, leveraged NLP techniques to process the text data, analyzed the data by sentiment analysis using TextBlob and IBM Tone Analyzer, and created Tableau dashboard to present the results.
# Overview
To visualize Sentiments of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements based on tweets with the relevant #tags on twitter and build dashboards as a daily sentiment monitor product to present the results.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is as follows:
1. To gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics such as lockdown guidelines, government rules, work from home, etc. 
2. To use sentiment analysis as a means to gauge public opinion so that the concerned authority can be able to strategize and plan for the future.
# Existing Problem
Everyone around the globe today is holed up in their homes, scared of human touch, as a minuscule virus took down their entire world. We are all emotionally impacted in some way. With fear, loneliness, anxiety, depression, social isolation, anger, paranoia, economic hardship, surplus of new warnings do's and don'ts - those already on edge have been pushed over, while others have been pushed closer to the precipice. On one hand we have millions fighting the illness and on the other hand many are worried of contracting it.
 
Rumours and warnings abound in a situation where nobody seems to know any better. Everyone has advice to share, but nobody can guarantee protection. Caught in the midst of so many instructions, we tend to lose touch with our own common sense and the place from where we draw our feelings of security.
 
Social interactions and face-to-face connection are important to us, but today we are forced to socially distance ourselves. Disrupting these bonds leads to health problems such as psychological issues, depression, high BP and heart disease. 
 
So now we are in a situation where instinctively we ache for connection and technology has been a big help in keeping us connected, ensuring the feeling of closeness and shared identity, which helps in times of crises. We need to find innovative ways and means around the present crisis. Many of these may form the design of our future lives!

# Proposed solution
In order to gain respite from the existing problem and give our small yet valuable contribution, we proposed a solution which is described as follows-
The Corona Virus pandemic poses a threat to our physical health, but alongside, living a Covid-lifestyle (social distancing, lockdown extensions, work from home, etc.) also endangers our emotional well-being. Thus, it is crucial to understand public sentiments under COVID-19. 
Our proposed solution aims at developing an application to visualize sentiments of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements based on tweets with the relevant hash tags on twitter and build dashboards as a daily sentiment monitor product to present the results. It will give a simple interface which will present the public approach of people in India on varied topics through their sentiments visualised as graphs onto beautified dashboards by simply hitting a button in the app. 
This proposed system will come in handy as it comes with a simple user interface which will enable users to get quick and reliable overview of the public approach.
